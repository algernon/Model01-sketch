algernon's firmware sketch for the Keyboardio Model01
=====================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/algernon/Model01-sketch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/algernon/Model01-sketch)

This is my work in progress firmware Sketch for
the [Keyboard.io Model 01][kbdio], based on the [Akela][akela] library. Like the
library, this has not been tested on real hardware yet.

This is a reasonably complete example of how to work with [Akela][akela], to
extend it, to compose the various components, to have something useful in the
end.
