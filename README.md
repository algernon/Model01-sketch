algernon's firmware sketch for the Keyboardio Model01
=====================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/algernon/Model01-sketch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/algernon/Model01-sketch)

This is my work in progress firmware Sketch for
the [Keyboardio Model 01][kbdio], using the [KeyboardioFirmware][kbfw] together
with a fair amount of plugins.

This is a reasonably complete example of how to work with the firmware, and
surrounding libraries, to extend it, to compose the various components, to have
something useful in the end.

 [kbfw]: https://github.com/keyboardio/KeyboardioFirmware
 [kbdio]: https://shop.keyboard.io/

It is a heavy work in progress, with some awful hacks and workarounds here and
there. Eventually these will be cleaned up.
